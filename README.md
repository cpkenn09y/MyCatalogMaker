# Creating a Catalog Maker

## Link to the live project:
http://cpkenn09y.github.io/MyCatalogMaker/

## Technology Choices:

* Would have been in my comfort zone to use Ruby on Rails => Decided Not to Use RoR
* Had never used in Backbone.js => Decided YES!
* Had never used Firebase => Decided YES!
* Use them in combination to make a webapp the updates in realtime!
* Excited about the challenge!!

## How to Run It Locally:

* Open Terminal App: (copy and paste the contents to the right of the arrow into the Terminal)
  * -> cd Desktop
  * -> git clone https://github.com/cpkenn09y/MyCatalogMaker.git
  * -> cd MyCatalogMaker
  * -> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
    * Open Google Chrome and enter the URL - http://localhost:8000

## Challenges Along the Way:

* Zero knowledge of Backbone.js => Learn Backbone.js
* Zero knowledge of Firebase => Learn Firebase
* Use both harmoniously => "Backfire" (Backbone + Firebase)
* Read lots of documentation
* Learn learn learn!
* Devise a plan of execution
* Trying to iterate over a collection as soon as the page loads caused problems
  * The collection instance had to first sync up with the db since asynchronous
* Make it look presentable

## For Funsies:

* Create more items, and see the data immediately loaded into the DB
* Play around with screen resizing, to see the media queries at play

Note: The actual coding of this project was completed within 24 hours.

## Future Improvements

* Add validations for the instantiation of an Item
* Use BackboneView listeners to enable Editing and Deletion of items
* Use require.js to decrease the number of calls made to the server
* Extract the templates from the View
* Add user registration or OAuth
* Allow user to create multiple items with one click
* Consider using handlebars.js
